# Hey guys, nice job. My feedback will be in the feedback folder. In general, it's one feedback file corresponding to a file.

### Of course, you can always message me on slack if you have any questions.

Thanks for putting a `.gitignore`! Didn't have to automatically download node_modules.
Would've been better if I had also received the schema of how the tables looked like, so I'd be able to test more.

All in all, nice application! ðŸ˜„
