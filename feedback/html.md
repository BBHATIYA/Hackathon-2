**Things to improve**

-   It's ok to reuse the same stylesheet in many html pages. In fact, it can be a very good thing. However, the same doesn't apply for script tags. If you're on the news page, you aren't trying to log in, so why bring the sendLogin function into your page? Basically, better to make more specific scripts for each page. That way, you aren't bringing in unnecessary functionality into that page. This improves script load time, makes your code more maintainable, and is safer in the long run from a number of angles.
